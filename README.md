# Reverse-Boolean
I made this with all the knowledge I learnt during work and put something together

I made this simple project that just reverses the BOOL. I was testing myself with the knowledge I have learnt and then put it together with some free time.

I had my code reviewed by another team member and then I did the suggested changes.

The issue I was having with the code was that it was crashing with a, "Null exception", the fix was simple and changed the line of code, so I didn't need to add in the Exception Handling.
